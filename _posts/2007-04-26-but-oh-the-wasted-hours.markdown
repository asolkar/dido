<p>Few months back when I installed <a href="http://tech.mahesha.com/2007/01/29/ubuntu-610-the-edgy-eft-on-sony-vaio-vgn-t140p/" title="Ubuntu 6.10 (the Edgy Eft) on Sony Vaio VGN-T140P">Edgy on my Sony laptop</a>, audio wasn't working right out of the box. I had to spend a few days googling and <em>ubuntu-forumming</em> to find the fix for that. Eventually it worked fine after un-muting some channels in the Volume Control.</p>
<p>Last weekend I upgraded to <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyFawn" title="Ubuntu 7.04 the Feisty Fawn">Feisty</a>. Again the same thing - audio is gone. Once again I found myself googling and <em>ubuntu-forumming</em> to see if people were having the same problem - and they were. So I was convinced that there was something wrong with audio in Feisty.</p>
<p>Until last night, when I accidentally hit the 'Mute' button on the laptop! I don't remember that button working in Edgy! So I guess its a good thing after all :)</p>
<p>But oh, the wasted hours :(</p>
