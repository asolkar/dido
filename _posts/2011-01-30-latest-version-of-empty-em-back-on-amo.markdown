<p>Recently, Mozilla made it mandatory that each add-on hosted on AMO (<a href="http://addons.mozilla.org" target="_blank">addons.mozilla.org</a>) be reviewed. To comply, I had to upload the latest version of my Thunderbird addon - Empty 'em to AMO.</p>
<p>As pointed in my <a href="http://tech.mahesha.com/2010/12/18/empty-em-v0-76-available-on-github/" target="_blank">earlier post</a>, I was not so much for it, since AMO wouldn't allow a coarser control on maxVersion of the add-on.</p>
<p>But in any case, Empty 'em is now reviewed and available from AMO:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/empty-em/" target="_blank">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/empty-em/</a></p></blockquote>
<p>If you notice, the add-on is still marked experimental. This is because I only did a <em>preliminary review</em> of the add-on. I'll wait until I get some more user feedback until I request a <em>full review</em> - after which, the add-on will come out of its experimental phase.</p>

<div class="caption">Empty â€˜em now has automatic updates</div>
</div>
<p>On the positive side though, the add-on will get automatic updates. And I've also seen increased number of downloads in the past few days. I guess it always hurts to be in the search results on AMO.</p>
<p>As usual, for support on the add-on, head to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/empty-em-support">Empty 'em Support Group</a>.</p>
