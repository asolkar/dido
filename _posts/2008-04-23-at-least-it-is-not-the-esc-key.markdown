<p>Just over a year ago, I spilled coffee on my keyboard at work. Almost entire left side of the keyboard was ruined. The buttons had become sticky from the mocha and were acting stubborn. I replaced it with a new ergonomic keyboard. Life was good.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, I built a cheap computer at home. Instead of buying a new keyboard, I decided to clean the coffee on my old keyboard at work and put it to use with my home computer. Most of the keys work fine after cleaning. I don't end up using the keyboard at home as much as I do at work, so things are working pretty well.</p>
<p>That was until the past Monday. On Monday, I found that one - just one - key on the new (well, not so new anymore, but comparitively) keyboard at work is being insensitive. That key had to be the <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/colon-wordnet" title="colon (punctuation)">colon (:)</a> key! As a <a href="http://www.vim.org" title="Vim web page">Vim</a> user, that spells trouble.</p>
<p>I am OK using the almost 50% ruined keyboard at home. But using an otherwise perfect keyboard with just an insesitive colon is proving to be a big pain in the&#0133; oh boy&#0133; no pun intended what-so-ever!</p>
<p>But then again, at least it is not the &lt;ESC&gt; key!</p>
