<p>I installed Ubuntu 6.10 on my Sony VAIO laptop about two weeks ago. Since then, I have installed umpteen modules/packages to get some functionality or the other working. Right from detecting the widescreen to being able to play MP3 files.</p>
<p>In the excitement of getting things to work, I did it in kind of an urgency. As a result, I don't really remember which modules got working which functionality. The mode of operation was to google for the problem I had, then try out all the remedies various people suggested until one worked. I am pretty sure there are certain things I did that were not really needed. I want to start clean again and document the process. But looking back at it, it looks like a mammoth task.</p>
<p>So far I have used Synaptic Package Manager to install/remove all the packages. I wish there was something in the Package Manager that would tell me which packages I added since the initial install. Even better, it could <em>export</em> a list of packages that exist in my Ubuntu installation. Then I could <em>import</em> this file after a fresh install and get back to the state I am now. Similar could be done for <code>.conf</code> files that were added or modified.</p>
<p>Now, this may be wishful thinking or it may as well already in there somewhere. If it's wishful thinking I think its a useful feature. If its already in there, I just haven't found it yet. If you know something that does this, drop in a comment.</p>
