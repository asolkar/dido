<p><a title="Mac OS X" href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> is mine. Its not perfect - and I'll blog about this in future - but it's far better than alternatives available.</p>
<p>Linux is climbing fast on my favorite charts. I've been playing with <a title="Ubuntu" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu6.10 (Edgy Eft)</a> last few weeks. I am extremely happy with what I have seen so far. This distribution/version is the best I have tried.</p>
<p>High tech industry is my field of work, which means I deal with computers a lot at work. At home, however, I want to spend more time being productive using computers, not maintaining them. So I usually don't want to spend a lot of time compiling kernels, trying out drivers, playing with .conf files to get things working.</p>
<p>In the past I have - on multiple occasions - given up on Linux when it came to Wireless LAN. It happened with more than one versions of Redhat, Fedora Core, Suse and some other distributions. So installing Ubuntu and getting almost everything working out of the box - including Wireless LAN - was a welcome surprise.</p>
<p>You gotta love Linux, its free, less (almost not?) prone to virus attacks, powerful. And now its easy to install and maintain. It a win-win.</p>
<p>Although it was the easiest Linux install so far for me, it was not a cakewalk. I'll blog about the difficulties, problems and solutions in the future.</p>
