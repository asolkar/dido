<p>Now, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/4797004.stm" title="BBC SPORT | Cricket | SA shatter record to beat Aussies">this</a> is a match I'd have loved to see live!</p>
<p>Coming to think of it... I bet I would have left the game after the first innings - only to learn from the news that it was South Africa who won :)</p>
<p>Oh well, May be I'll get a recording somewhere. Looking...</p>
