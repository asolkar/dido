<p>Mayur married Anu on 26th June. I am glad I could attend. It was a fantastic ceremony.</p>
<p>By the way, Anu is now known as Saanika!</p>
<p>I've uploaded selected pictures of the wedding in my <a href="http://www.mahesha.com/cgi-bin/browseSnaps.pl?album=17&action=start">photo albums</a>. Do take some time and view them. The wedding was also webcasted on Yahoo! video. Quite a few friends and relatives in India could witness the wedding that way.</p>
<p>I met a lot of new friends, and some old ones too. The food was great. All in all, had a great time.</p>
