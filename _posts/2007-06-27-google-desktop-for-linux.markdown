<p>To me, this was a long time coming. <a href="http://googledesktop.blogspot.com/2007/06/desktop-for-linux.html" title="Google Desktop for Linux">Google Desktop Search</a> for Linux is finally here. I did not waste time trying it out. So far it looks pretty impressive...</p>

<p>It does not have the sidebar and gadgets like the windows version, but the desktop search seems good so far.</p>
