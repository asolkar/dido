<p>I keep my wireless router (a D-Link DI-624) on the second level of my house. Almost always, I work on the main level. One of my computers is right under the router - kind of in a shadow area(?) The other place I usually work in not directly under - not so much in the shadow area.</p>
<p>Recently I noticed that the signal strength on the computer directly under was far inferior to that in other locations in the house. I wondered if that was because the antenna on the router happened to be in an upright position.</p>
<p>Just to try out, I tilted the antenna such that it is almost at 45 degrees away from the walls around. To my surprise, it improved the signal strength on the computer directly under from about 20% to 80%!!</p>
<p>And I always thought the antenna was omnidirectionalâ€¦</p>
