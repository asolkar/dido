    is something I was waiting for since a long time. Gmail&#8217;s POP access is
    too inadequate when it came to accessing Gmail from multiple desktop [...]'

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/" title="Google Website">Google</a>, which started as just a search engine, has so many tools and services now. Lot of them are useful in everyday life.</p>
<h3>Tool Integration related</h3>
<p>It is nice to see how these tools/services work with each other so well:</p>
<ul>
<li> Google Talk in <a href="https://mail.google.com/" title="Gmail Website">Gmail</a></li>
<li> Online status, Google talk in <a href="https://www.orkut.com/" title="Orkut Website">Orkut</a></li>
<li> Gmail contacts, Google Talk in <a href="https://docs.google.com/" title="Google Documents and Spreadsheets Website">Docs and Spreadsheets</a></li>
<li> Gmail and <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar" title="Google Calendar Website">Calendar</a> </li>
<li> Maps and <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/home" title="Picasa Web Albums Website">Picasa Web Albums</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>... to mention a few. But there are still quite a few that would be nice to have. Following is a kind of a wish list of some ways Google tools could work together and enhance the user experience - from my perspective:</p>
<p><strong>Google maps</strong> still seems like a standalone tool. On its own, it is probably the best online maps website. Some of the new features are really useful. My Maps, re-routing directions, the newly added third party content etc. But Google Maps doesn't seem to integrate well with rest of the Google tools.</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be nice to be able to pick locations in My Maps as venues in Calendar, for instance</li>
<li>How about a My Maps collection of all the Gmail contacts</li>
<li>My Maps collection for geo-tagged albums in Picasa Web Albums</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Google Calendar</strong> is well integrated with Gmail. But it would be nice to have a Google Docs and Spreadsheets document/spreadsheet attached to an appointment. For instance, if the appointment is a party, a spreadsheet of party supplies to be bought, party activities planned, etc.</p>
<h3>Other</h3>
<p><strong><del cite="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2007/10/sync-your-inbox-across-devices-with.html" datetime="20071024" title="See comment 1">IMAP access to Gmail</del></strong> must be on the top of many Gmail users' wish lists. I am hoping that the Gmail team is secretly working on this! If and when IMAP is supported, I'd like to see tags in the header of messages - that can be added and read by the desktop mail application. The current POP access available with Gmail is only good if Gmail is accessed from just one desktop. And the tags, the feature of Gmail that I love the most, is totally useless with POP access.</p>
<p><strong>Google Calendar plugin for iCal</strong> is something that I had expected to be out after <a href="http://googlemac.blogspot.com/" title="Google Mac Team Blog">Mac Team</a> was formed at Google. But hasn't happened so far. There are <a href="http://spanningsync.com/" title="Spanning Sync">other</a> <a href="http://www.macness.com/blog/index.php/site/products/" title="gSync">solutions</a> that provide the functionality, but something coming from Google would be nice to have (like the <a href="http://picasa.google.com/web/mac_tools.html" title="Mac Tools from Picasa">Picasa Web Albums plugin for iPhoto</a>.)</p>
<p>I am sure there is going to be a sequel to this post some time soon, with more wishes. When that happens, I'll love to see some of the above wishes already granted!</p>
