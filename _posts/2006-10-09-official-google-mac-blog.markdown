<p>In the new <a href="http://googlemac.blogspot.com/2006/10/google-and-your-mac.html">Official Google Mac Blog</a>, Google mentions there's a Mac team that has started to show results. This is great!</p>
<p>I've always had this <i>Google wish list</i> on the Mac...</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Talk: I'd not want Google to make Google Talk client for Mac. What I'd love is a full functional integration of <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/" title="Google Talk">Google Talk</a> features into <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ichat/" title="Apple iChat">iChat</a> - voice, file transfer, buddy icons and what not.</li>
<li>Google Calendar: Again a full functional integration of <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar" title="Google Calendar">Google Calendar</a> features into <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ical/" title="Apple iCal">iCal</a>. Currently I can only subscribe to my Google Calendar from iCal. I should be able to edit my calendar too. I am sure the API is all in place, an iCal plugin is probably the missing link.</li>
<li>Useful Widgets: <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/" title="Mac OS X Tiger Dashboard">Dashboard widgets</a> for <a href="http://www.google.com/notebook/" title="Google Notebook">Google Notebook</a>, Google Calendar Agenda etc., would be great! I'd imagine converting Google Gadgets to Dashboard Widgets should be doable</li>
</ul>
<p>I can almost hear Google say "<em>So be it!</em>" :)</p>
