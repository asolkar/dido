<p>Home page of this website (<a href="http://www.mahesha.com/" title="Home page - used to be 'i think so...'">http://www.mahesha.com/</a>) used to be a WordPress blog, called <em>i think so...</em>. I found that I was seldom updating it. Whenever I did, it was mostly technology related - something I could very easily include in this blog.</p>
<p>So, I am retiring <em>i think so...</em>. In its place, the home page of this website will just be a launch pad for the rest of the stuff here.</p>
<p>I've kept a <a href="http://blog.mahesha.com/" title="what used to be 'i think so...'">frozen copy of the blog</a>, just in case...</p>
