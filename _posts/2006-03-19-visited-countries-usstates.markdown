<p>Now, this is an interesting couple of pages.</p>
<p><a href="http://douweosinga.com/projects/visitedcountries">Visited Countries Map</a> visualizes the countries you have visited and <a href="http://douweosinga.com/projects/visitedstates">Visited States Map</a> visualizes the states in US you have visited!</p>
<p>Here's what I got for the US states</p>
<p><img src="images/visited_us.gif" title="US States I have visited" alt="States Visited Map" /></p>
<p>And this is for the countries (although I included countries I have transited to make it look impressive ;) )</p>
<p><img src="images/visited_world.gif" title="Countries I have been in" alt="Countries Visited Map" /></p>
