<p>I was on a road trip from July 2 to July 10. A friend - Krishna, and I went to Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, Arches National Park and Canyonlands National Park.</p>
<p>About 3500 miles... and just one speeding ticket :)</p>
<p>Stop by my site to see the <a href="http://www.mahesha.com/cgi-bin/browseSnaps.pl?album=18&amp;action=start&amp;crrnt=1">pictures from the trip</a>.</p>
