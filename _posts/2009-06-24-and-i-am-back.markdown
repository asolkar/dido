<p>After days of going back and forth between registrars, this domain name - <em>mahesha.com</em> - is finally transferred. What a relief!</p>
<p>Many apologies for the downtime over the past few days.</p>
<p>The process of transferring domain between registrars, as simple as it sounds, was anything but. At least in my case. In about a month's time, took three attempts, coordination with losing/gaining registrars and more than a week's downtime to get it right.</p>
<p>After all the confusion, I think,  <em>mahesha.com</em> and all its sub-domains of are now up and running.</p>
<p>I must say, so far, I am loving my new host - <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?529423">DreamHost</a> (Here's a promo code if you want to sign up with them: <strong>MMAGOTUDREAM</strong>). I hope it stays that way!</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
