<p>Just enabled the complimentary Verizon Wireless 3G service for my Cr-48. It took about 5-7 minutes but it was painless.</p>
<p>Only thing that beats me is why I had to enter my credit card information to get the free service - they say it is for confirming the identity. Couldn't Google/Verizon use Checkout account to do that?</p>
<p>Now I should really make a folder for text-only/mobile versions of websites I frequent. It's only been a few minutes and I've already used up 5MB of data!</p>
<p>Speed seems good though. I am switching back to Wifi, and keep this service for the rainy day.</p>
