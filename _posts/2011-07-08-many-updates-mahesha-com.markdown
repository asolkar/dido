<p>After a long, long while, finally got some time to update many parts of mahesha.com that were on my to-do list.</p>
<p><strong>Blog Theme</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the good guys at <a href="http://www.obox-design.com/" title="Obox Design" target="_blank">Obox Design</a> my blog at <a href="http://tech.mahesha.com" title="My Technology Blog" target="_blank">tech.mahesha.com</a> (this blog) has a new, clean theme that I really like. I hope everything is setup correctly. Some broken links, etc. are expected. But I should be able to clean that up in the coming few days.</p>
<p><strong>Home Page</strong></p>
<p>Home page at <a href="http://mahesha.com" title="Home Page" target="_blank">mahesha.com</a> is completely refreshed. I've been working on this for a while now. It is still kind of a work in progress, but I think it is ready enough to be made live.</p>
<p><strong>Favicon</strong></p>
<p>This is a minor change. The favicon that I use on most of my sites, which is also my avatar on many sites, is pretty old. I created it it many moons ago when I had a Mac, with Photoshop installed. I have, since, moved to using Linux and open source software for most of my computational needs. As such, I always wanted to recreate the image using <a href="http://www.gimp.org/" title="GIMP website" target="_blank">GIMP</a>. I finally got to doing it. And as a starting point, I am updating the favicons on the home page and the blog to use the newly created image. Soon I'll update favicons and avatars on other sites too.</p>
<p><strong>Authorship</strong></p>
<p>While I am at updating the blog theme, I though I'd implement the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=1229920" title="Google Webmaster Tools - Authorship" target="_blank">Authorship</a> mechanism that Google recently launched. With a excellent instructions at from <a href="http://yoast.com/wordpress-rel-author-rel-me/" target="_blank">various</a> <a href="http://www.blindfiveyearold.com/how-to-implement-rel-author" target="_blank">sources</a>, I have tried to implement <code>rel=author</code>. I will be eager to see if the effects show in search results in the coming few days.</p>
<p><strong>Wordpress 3.2</strong></p>
<p>It has become almost a weekly exercise, but this blog is also updated to the latest <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2011/07/gershwin/" target="_blank">Wordpress 3.2</a>. I hope it stays current for at least some weeks.</p>
<p>Cheers for now!</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, you can find me on <a href="https://plus.google.com/104769499705387203231" title="Google+ profile" target="_blank">Google+</a>!</p>
