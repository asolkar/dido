<p>So have you been following World Cup? I have!</p>
<p>Considering the game times, it has only been a half-or-two during lunch time. So far my luck hasn't been that great, all the scoring is happening before or after the lunch time!</p>
<p>I watch the games on a Spanish channel, so all I understand from the commentary is names of the players and of course the emphatic GOOOOL!</p>
<p>But I found this great <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/add-ons/jogacompanion/" title="Joga Companion!">companion</a>. You should try it too... At home or at work, it keeps me up-to-date with the games - unintrusively. Like <a href="http://www.joga.com/" title="Nike/Google Soccer comunity website">Joga.com</a> says, it is like <i><a href="http://www.getfirefox.com" title="Mozilla Firefox">Firefox</a> obsessed with Football</i>!</p>
<p>Cheers...</p>
