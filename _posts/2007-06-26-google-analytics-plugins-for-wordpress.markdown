<p>If you have a <a href="http://wordpress.org/" title="WordPress home page">WordPress</a> blog and use <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" title="Google Analytics home page">Google Analytics</a> to track its usage, you should consider using one of the following plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://tantannoodles.com/toolkit/wordpress-reports/" title="Get 'WordPress Reports' here">WordPress Reports</a> from Tan Tan Noodles</li>
<li><a href="http://www.semiologic.com/software/marketing/google-analytics/" title="Get 'Google Analytics Plugin' here">Google Analytics</a> from Semiologic</li>
</ul>
<p>Both considerably simplify Google Analytics usage with WordPress. You don't have to open any WordPress file and physically enter the Analytics code. This is especially important if you change your WordPress theme every once a while - or may be upgrade to a later version of a theme.</p>
<p>I personally prefer the one from Semiologic because it ignores your hits if you are logged in as a author, editor or the admin. Without this feature, I was getting too many false hits on <code>'/?p=XX&preview=true'</code> every time I wrote a new post using <em>Save and Continue Editing</em> feature of WordPress.</p>
