    does allow OpenID and ID login but nothing else. That is worse than I had before
    ID. If I can figure it out,  I will like the plugin but if not, it will have to

    between Coke and Pepsi - it&#39;s a personal choice.<br><br>I do like Coke. And

  content: I enjoyed this, because I&#39;ve just recently decided to try them out
    as well. I sided with ID after trying both. Seemed to work great, but I was using
    Firefox forgot to try it in IE. Some reason from the main blog page, clicking
    the Comments link in FF works perfectly and goes to the post page and the comment
    section. In IE just to the post page and you have to scroll down for the comment
    section. Might just be my blog coding not compatible, I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve
    been recoding everything to my liking, but ID support is checking into it, got
    quick response. I think I&#39;ll stick with ID, Disqus seems more clunky somehow.<br><br>Also
    just noticed tho, that with ID ticking the "tweet this" box didn&#39;t tweet anything.
    Of course, after reading your post here apparently you have to be signed in to
    comment with your Twitter account, which is stupid since by default I&#39;m signed
    with my ID id.

    to note, Intense Debate is owned by the parent organization of Worpdress (Automattic
    - <a href="http://automattic.com/" rel="nofollow">http://automattic.com/</a>).   <br><br>You&#39;ve
    also failed to describe (and this may be due to the date of your review) all the
    great plugins that Intense Debate provides with a single click in the admin interface.  Polls,
    Video, Translate and more.  You&#39;ll have to excuse my ignorance here, but the
    last time I tried DIsqus they were lacking in the plugins area.<br><br>So it might
    not be a choice betwee Coke vs. Pepsi.  There are some little advantages to ID,
    if they matter to you.

    wrote this.<br><br>I am currently using Disqus because I had a hard time handling
    spam in IntenseDebate comments. I must say I haven&#39;t seen a lot of spam since
    then. I used Akismet in both, so I wonder what made the difference.<br><br>The
    last post I wrote on this blog, I wanted to add a poll. I checked IntenseDebate,
    it has a plug-in for PollDaddy, Disqus doesn&#39;t! I almost switched back to
    IntenseDebate. But I thought I&#39;d give Disqus another couple months.<br><br>After
    I wrote this review, I started using IntenseDebate for just the reason you mentioned
    - it is owned by the same organization that owns WordPress. I am sure I&#39;ll
    go back to IntenseDebate, one of these days.<br><br>However I love the fact that
    there is choice. It has been fairly easy to switch between the two too.<br><br>I
    do think that Disqus has a larger user base as compared to IntenseDebate - at
    least among the kind of blogs I read. That sometimes helps.<br><br>I agree that
    there are little advantages - but that is subjective, like you said, to what matters
    to you.

  content: "Good review. I have been using Disqus on one of my blogs and have been
    contemplating using ID on another. I just listened to a WordPress Weekly podcast
    this past weekend where they interviewed Michael Koeing from ID. ID has recently
    linked their users profiles with WordPress.com which gives them 12+ million users.
    I&#039;m not sure how that compares to Disqus, but it as to be a big boost.  \n
    \nAlso, ID synchronizes the comments stored on their servers with your WordPress
    blog, so that the comments are stored in both places so that if the ID servers
    are down, the comments load from the local WordPress database. If you ever leave
    ID for some reason, there is nothing to do but deactivate the plugin.  Plus, there
    are a lot more plugins and customization features. ID still does not have the
    Twitter reactions feature that Disqus has, but I think it might be starting to
    edge out Disqus in features.   \n "

    system, you should not lose any comments. Only problem I have come across is that,
    if you have threaded conversations in your comments, threads may not stay intact
    when you switch. \n \nI ran into that a while back, and I don&#039;t remember
    if it was ID-&gt;Disqus or Disqus-&gt;ID switch. There are good chances that it
    has been fixed since. \n \nIf you have worries, I would contact ID support to
    get the latest status/facts. \nMy recent post <a href=\"http:\\/\\/github.com\\/asolkar\\/emptyem\\/commit\\/e68926717379644de1ae3b3accc34ab87259127b\"

<p>This blog is, by no means, a heavy traffic blog that receives hundreds of comments. So managing comments is not one of my headaches! <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> does a good job of filtering spam, and that is pretty much what I need for this blog.</p>
<p>I've been learning PHP lately (sounds off topic, but stay with me here). The project I've started, as a tool for learning PHP, is a blogging platform. Being just a study project, it is as simple as it can get. Posts are saved in text files - a la <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/">blosxom</a>. PHP merely displays the posts in a readable/navigable manner.</p>
<p>In order to keep the project simple, I had no plans of implementing comments in the blogging platform. No database. I called it <a href="http://code.google.com/p/onlyblog/">OnlyBlog</a>.</p>
<p>I soon figured that a blog has no soul without comments. So I decided to support hosted comment services like <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> and <a href="http://www.intensedebate.com/">IntenseDebate</a>.</p>
<p>As I became more and more familiar with these comment systems, I thought this <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> blog could use enhanced comment system too. Immediately, the question was, <em>IntenseDebate or Disqus?</em> Since IntenseDebate is owned by <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, who also owns WordPress, I figured that IntenseDebate should be the best choice. Since then, comments on this blog are managed by IntenseDebate.</p>
<p>However, like many I came across the internet, I still haven't found a good answer to the question <em>IntenseDebate or Disqus?</em> So I decided to read a little about both and do a fair comparison. Here's what I found (note - this is in no way a comprehensive review or comparison of the comment systems):</p>
<p>I'll start with the point of view of a blogger who uses one of the popular blogging platforms. Next, I'll deal with the point of view of a developer who wants to integrate these comment systems into an unsupported blogging platform.</p>
<h4>Blogger/Commenter point of view</h4>
<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<p>Both Disqus and IntenseDebate have plug-ins for most of the popular blogging platforms - Disqus supports WordPress, Blogger, Tumblr, MovableType, while IntenseDebate supports WordPress, Blogger, TypePad, and Tumblr . This makes installation and management of the comment system very easy.</p>
<p>I tried both on my WordPress blog. Both Disqus and IntenseDebate add elaborate configuration panels to the WordPress Dashboard, where you can customize their behavior in great detail. Both Disqus and IntenseDebate also imported the existing native WordPress comments into their own systems. In my case, IntenseDebate imported the comments flawlessly. Disqus, however, had some (unspecified) error during import and could import only a handful of comments - but that may just be the case with my blog. I'll give Disqus another shot sometime soon, hopefully with better results.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<p>Features of both comment systems are listed on their respective websites - <a href="http://disqus.com/comments/">Disqus</a> / <a href="http://intensedebate.com/features">IntenseDebate</a>. As you will find out, the features are comparable for all practical purposes. Both systems support threading of comments, notification when someone comments on your thread, the ability to reply by email, even moderate by email.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong></p>
<p>One of the things I like about both Disqus and IntenseDebate is that they provide a variety of ways to authenticate a commenter. A Disqus/IntenseDebate account is great, but not required - being registered on your blog is definitely required. Visitor can use OpenID, Twitter or Facebook to authenticate. I do prefer some kind of authentication, to a guest comment.</p>
<p>Here's a couple of screenshots that show how the comment entry interface in the two comment systems looks when you are not logged in. </p>

<p>Pretty similar, isn't it!</p>
<p><strong>Spam</strong></p>
<p>Even a not-so-busy blog like mine accumulates thousands of spam comments over period. Both Disqus and IntenseDebate have effective spam filters. I was happy to know that Akismet can be used on both the systems - since I was already using it before I switched to enhanced comments, and was loving it.</p>
<p><strong>Moderation</strong></p>
<p>Again Disqus and IntenseDebate sport a similar comment moderation functionality. Comments can be edited, deleted, marked as spam, etc. They both support having multiple blogs under one account. This is very convenient if you manage multiple blogs. Like I mentioned before, comments can be moderated by replying to notification email with appropriate moderation command also.</p>
<p><strong>Social</strong></p>
<p>For visitors who have a wide social presence, both systems allow cross posting to different social networks - a comment can be sent to Twitter, a comment can be put on your Facebook wall, etc.</p>
<p>From my experience, IntenseDebate only allows you to tweet your comment if you used Twitter to sign in. Disqus always provides you with this option, no matter how you signed in - I like that!</p>

<p>Instead of posting more screenshots, I'll encourage you to experience <a href="http://blog.disqus.com/">Disqus</a> and <a href="http://blog.intensedebate.com/">IntenseDebate</a> on their respective blogs.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>
<p>Both these comment systems are extremely feature rich, to the extent of being complicated. However, the documentation on both websites does not scale up to the level of complexity of the features. All features are listed with very few details. Specifics are left for you to figure out. It would be nice if the Twitter connection and the Facebook connection was documented in a little more detail - for the not-so-Web-2.0-savvy folks!</p>
<p><strong>Support</strong></p>
<p>Like I said, documentation on <a href="http://disqus.com/help/">Disqus</a> and <a href="http://intensedebate.com/help/">IntenseDebate</a> leaves a bit to be desired. However, both <a href="http://twitter.com/disqus">@disqus</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/IntenseDebate">@intensedebate</a> are active and very responsive on <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>.</p>
<h4>Developer point of view</h4>
<p>I am not a hardcore developer, merely a PHP newbie trying to get my hands wet in the web-tech. So the developer point of view I present is specific to the little project I described above.</p>
<p>There are two aspects of commenting that I want to incorporate into the project - how the visitor enters comments and display of comment count on the index page.</p>
<p><strong>Comment entry</strong></p>
<p>In both Disqus and IntenseDebate, adding a comment entry text box at the bottom of a blog post is as easy as including a short JavaScript snippet in the HTML. This small stub brings in all the goodness of rich comment system. You can adjust appearance and functionality of comment input from your Disqus Comments settings or IntenseDebate Dashboard. Comment systems know how to associate comments made on a page to the blog post based on the URL of the page (permalink).</p>
<p><strong>Comment count</strong></p>
<p>It is neat to have a little comment count next to the blog post title on the index page. Both Disqus and IntenseDebate have ways to do this. This is one place I think a little more detailed documentation would greatly help. I could somehow get Disqus to do what I want. But I am still struggling with IntenseDebate. Both sites don't make it clear on how to achieve this - what happened to good-old examples??</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Asking <em>IntenseDebate or Disqus?</em> is like asking <em>Coke or Pepsi?</em>. People have their reasons to pick one over the other (although I don't get why people drink Pepsi when there's Coke!... well, see? :) ).</p>
<p>It is a matter of personal choice. What may seem like a minor feature missing may be a deal breaker for someone else. I use IntenseDebate on this WordPress blog, just because it worked out best. I don't know how long it will stay - as new versions come out from Disqus and IntenseDebate.</p>
<p>If you are trying to decide between the two, it behooves you to at least try both. They are both free and easily available on most blogging platforms. And they are both awesome!</p>
<p>Incidentally, is there a third (or a fourth) hosted comment system out there waiting to be discovered?</p>
