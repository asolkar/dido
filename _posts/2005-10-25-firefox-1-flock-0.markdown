<p>Like I said in my <a href="http://tech.mahesha.com/2005/10/20/just-started-flocking/">previous post</a>, I've been playing around with Flock.</p>
<p>So far, the only really useful feature I've found is this blog posting tool - which could use a spell checker, by the way. The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> bar, the <a href="http://del.icio.us/">shared bookmarks</a> are all good features but I did not end up using them a whole lot. Shared bookmarks don't preserve collections - when I sync bookmarks, I still have to move new entries into appropriate collections. This may be a limitation posed by del.icio.us bookmark format. Whatever it may be, its no better than importing exported bookmarks between Firefox installations.</p>
<p>So, to me Flock seemed more like a dressed up Firefox - and the get up is not compelling enough. Flock seems to be heading in the right direction, so I will probably check back with Flock in near future to see how its developing, but for now, Firefox is still my default browser on both windows and Mac.</p>
