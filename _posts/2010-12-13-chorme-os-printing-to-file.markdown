<p>I almost do not have a printer at home - I have an old one, but I use it so rarely, the cartridges are always dry. So when I need to print something, I usually print it to a file on my Linux laptop - a .pdf file. Then take that file to work/FedEx Kinko's - via Google Docs/Dropbox/other cloud service/USB drive - and print it. I am sure there are many who do that.</p>
<p>Also for archiving online transactions, like bank transfers, purchase acknowledgements, etc. - when you don't necessarily need a print out, but just want some kind of a digital confirmation you could print later if needed - 'print to file' is such a convenient feature to have.</p>
<p>Just wondering why Chrome OS got rid of the <em>print to file</em> feature of the underlying Linux OS? Google <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome?hl=en">cloud print</a> is cool and all, but if you don't have a Windows PC with a printer connected, you are really out of luck. Am I missing something, or Chrome OS indeed does not have a <em>print to file</em> option?</p>
