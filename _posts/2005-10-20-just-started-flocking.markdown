<p>Just got hands on the developer preview of <a href="http://www.flock.com/home/" title="Flock!">Flock</a>! For those who are unaware, Flock is what they call a <i>Social Browser</i> built on top of the Gecko rendering engine used by a more known <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com" title="Firefox Webpage">Mozilla Firefox</a>.</p>
<p>This - posting a blog post - is one of the very first Flock feature I am using. I'll probably use it to post many posts in the future, at least the ones about Flock!</p>
<p>Untill then... Cheers!</p>
