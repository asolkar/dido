<p>I'll be spending the next three weeks in India!</p>
<p>Looking forward to spending Diwali at home after a long-long while. I will be in Kolhapur most of the time. I'll spend some time in Pune too. The details are not known to me too!</p>
<p>I'll be back on the Thanksgiving weekend - in time for the ski season! Looking forward to that too. I hope mother nature is generous with the snow on the Hood.</p>
<p>More later..</p>
