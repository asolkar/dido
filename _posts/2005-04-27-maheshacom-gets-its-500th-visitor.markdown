<p>I have a <a href="http://st.mahesha.com/hits-script.shtml" title="Take a peek, if you understand Perl!">small utility</a> that runs on my computer that monitors the number of visits to my website - mahesha.com, and it reports if there was a new hit.</p>
<p>Well today, it reached a milestone! mahesha.com had its 500<sup>th</sup> visitor!</p>
<p><img src="/images/500-hits.jpg" title="500th Hit notification!"  alt="500th Hit notification!"/></p>
<p>This count is since the middle of last year - from what I remember. I gotta do something to attract more visitors :)</p>
<p>For the more curious, whenever you visit www.mahesha.com, a program on the site counts the visit, then it stores a <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/cookie-technology&method=6" title="Cookie! what is that??">cookie</a> on your machine as a marker that your visit has already been counted. The cookie sticks around for about 12 hours. The program counts your visit only if there is no cookie that it left. So if you visit the site again within 12 hours, you are a returning visitor, not a new visitor.</p>
