    to 2.3.1?"

<p>Just finished updating this blog to <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/09/wordpress-23/" title="WordPress 2.3 introduced">WordPress 2.3</a>. I moved from using categories to using tags - since I was using categories more like tags.</p>
<p>I love the <a href="http://www.ndesign-studio.com/resources/wp-themes/itheme/" title="iTheme home page">iTheme</a> theme. I haven't heard if it has been updated to be used with WordPress 2.3. My version of iTheme that worked with 2.2.* worked as-is with 2.3. I did make some small changes to use tags instead of categories.</p>
<p>Things seem to be working at this moment. If you find something missing/wrong, drop a comment.</p>
