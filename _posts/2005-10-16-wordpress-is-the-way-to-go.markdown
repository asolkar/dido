    Another note about Blogger import:

    When I republished archive from Blogger into WordPress area, it created directories like <code>/2005/04/</code>, <code>/2004/10/</code>, etc.

    (Possibly) since my permalink structure is /year/monthnum/ this caused some "Forbidden" errors accessing WordPress archives.

    If you import your blog from Blogger to WordPress, make sure you remove any directories created by Blogger-publish ... after the import is successful!

    Later...

  content: '[...] After switching to WordPress I was trying to get custom theme going
    for my blog, instead of using the WordPress default theme. I finally got down
    to getting one online yesterday. The new theme MMA Watch is remotely based on
    the default WordPress theme. Moreover I&#8217;ve set it up so that I can periodically
    change the header image to share one of the better photographs I keep taking every
    now-and-then. If I manage to accumulate a collection of such photographs, I wish
    to make a random selection of the header image. Every visit, you&#8217;ll see
    a different theme! More later&#8230; [...]'

<p>I've been planning this for quite a while - switch this blog to <a href="http://wordpress.org/" title="WordPress home page">WordPress</a>. Finally got to it this weekend. As I post this first one from WordPress, I can tell you, it feels great so far!</p>
<p>How to transfer all my old Blogger posts to WordPress? That was the only hold-up. A quick search on Google pointed me to <a href="http://wiki.wordpress.org/BloggerImport" title="Blogger import wiki">WordPress Blogger Importer wiki</a>. Followed the wiki entry step-by-step and all my old posts were in the WordPress database with fair amount of ease. There was one glitch though, for some reason, I had to move around some code to get the importer to work. Anyway, a little categorization later, I had the old Blogger posts all transfered to what you are seeing now!</p>
<p>Default WordPress theme looks pretty good to start with. I may end up using a readily available theme in the short run - may be create my own theme later. But for now this is it!</p>
<p>Until next time...<br />
Mahesh.</p>
