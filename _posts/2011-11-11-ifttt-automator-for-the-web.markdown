<p><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2488" title="About Automator" target="_blank">Automator</a> is a handy application in Mac OS X. It makes your everyday, repetitive tasks more efficient by chaining operations exported by variety of applications. It automates something you would manually do using multiple applications.</p>
<p>Recently I was introduced to <a href="http://ifttt.com/wtf" title="If this then that" target="_blank">ifttt</a> - short for <em>if this then that</em>. In their own words, <em>like 'lift' without the 'l'</em>. To me, this is an awesome tool! It provides an Automator like way of chaining <em>actions</em> provided by multiple web services, called <em>channels</em>, to create a workflow, or <em>Task</em>. Automating something I would manually do using multiple websites. The <em>Tasks</em> are set rolling on <em>Triggers</em> that are also defined for individual web service.</p>
<p>They also have hundreds of pre-canned tasks called <em>Recipes</em> that you can readily use.</p>
<p>I won't make this a help page about ifttt. You should visit <a href="http://ifttt.com/wtf" title="About ifttt" target="_blank">http://ifttt.com/wtf</a>, read all about it, and start being efficient on the web.</p>

<div class="caption">ifttt filter that should push this post to Tumblr and Posterous when this feed is updated. Let's see!  - Click for full size</div>
</div>
<p>If everything goes well, ifttt should post this blog post on my <a href="http://tumblr.mahesha.com" title="My Tumblr" target="_blank">Tumblr</a> and <a href="http://post.mahesha.com" title="My Posterous" target="_blank">Posterous</a>. If not, I probably need more reading and tweaking to do!</p>
