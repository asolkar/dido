<p>Now, this is something I am really looking forward to in the upcoming Ubuntu 10.10 release (a.k.a Maverick Meerkat):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OneConf">OneConf Wiki entry</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-maverick-oneconf">OneConf to rule them all - blueprint</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Idea is to store the state of your Ubuntu installation in the cloud, so that it can be cloned on some other machine, or used to restore after a brand new installation.</p>
<p>This is especially relevant because of the 6-month release cycle. I've spent many hours - if not days - to bring my system back to where I like it to be, after every fresh install. Furthermore, it may encourage folks to do a fresh install (versus an upgrade), thereby avoiding many problems that often arise after an upgrade. This is great for anyone who provides support on the the <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/">Ubuntu Forums</a> - or other support avenues.</p>
<p>Another reason I like this is that, features like this truly justify <a href="https://one.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu One</a>. Ubuntu One needs more ideas like OneConf to harness its great potential, and distinguish it from the other online storage/file sharing services. Not to mention the value it adds to Ubuntu as a desktop Linux distribution.</p>
<p>Somehow, all this sounds <a href="http://tech.mahesha.com/2007/01/15/state-of-installation/">very familiar!</a></p>
<p>Can't wait...</p>
