<p>So... the snow season this year took off to a great start last weekend when Aditi and I went up to <a href="http://www.skihood.com" title="Mt. Hood website">Mt. Hood</a> to break-in the Snowboard. Although I enjoyed a few hours of snowboarding in the most excellent snow I've experienced for a long-long while, Aditi just got a feel of the snow!</p>

<p>I had all plans to hit the slopes this weekend, but I had to postpone it in favor of preparing for the trip to Hawaii next week. Looks like the snow missed me as much as I missed it... so it showed up here in Hillsboro!</p>

<p>A welcome surprise, to me at least ;)</p>
