<p>As you probably know from tons of different sources, Firefox 3.5 was released yesterday. For all the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.5/releasenotes/" title="Firefox 3.5 Release Notes">new features and security updates</a>, I would highly recommend you to update to the latest release, if you already use an older version of Firefox. If you don't use Firefox, this is as good as any other time to try it. So go grab a copy...</p>

<p>Like many of the past Firefox releases, I used this release (code named Shiretoko) from its pre-alpha stages. It has developed into a solid release.</p>
<p>Now that this release is out, there will be many users to use it and report bugs. For me, it is time to grab the latest nightly builds and start using them. Hopefully file some bugs to help with testing.</p>
<p>Plans for the next version of Firefox - called the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Namoroka"  title="Firefox/Namoroka">Firefox.next</a> - are already in the making.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the Firefox developers on yet another great release. Now back to work on the next one...</p>
