<p>I have been using <a href="http://www.google.com/bookmarks/" title="Google Bookmarks web access">Google Bookmarks</a> for a while now. Needless to say, I like the <em>Bookmarks</em> button on the <a href="http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/toolbar/index.html" title="Google Toolbar webpage">Google Toolbar</a>. Although I don't really care about most of the other functionality in the toolbar. So I got rid of it (via <em>Customize</em>)! With Firefox's Bookmarks Toolbar not needed anymore, the browser window looks pretty clean!</p>

<p>I like this for now, may be until <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Places" title="What are Firefox Places?">Places</a> changes the bookmarks scene. I hope Google finds a way to seamlessly link Google Bookmarks with Places... that would be very useful.</p>
<p>Which reminds me of <a href="http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/" title="Google Browser Sync">Browser Sync</a>. I tried it, but quickly gave it up after I came across too many issues using it on different machines running different platforms. Another problem was that, at least at that point, there was no web access to manage Browser Sync data. You could only delete it! Google Bookmarks gives me greater control over the bookmarks database.</p>
<p>And what more, if need be, I can use Google Bookmarks with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/default.mspx" title="Internet Explorer webpage">IE</a> too! Well, for that matter, with any browser with access to <a href="http://www.google.com/bookmarks/" title="Google Bookmarks web access">http://www.google.com/bookmarks/</a></p>
