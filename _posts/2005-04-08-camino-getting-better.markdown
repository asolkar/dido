<p>I've become a big fan of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/" title="All about Firefix">Firefox browser</a>. I've been using it since its <a href="http://www.flexbeta.net/main/articles.php?action=show&id=89" title="A good read from Flexbeta about the history of Firefox">Phoenix days</a>. Its been so great to see it grow into this awesome piece of open source software.</p>
<p>Near the end of 2003, I made the switch to Mac - making it my primary computer (an iMac G4). I do have a windows laptop - I mostly use it for money management, I could not find a software like MS Money on Mac OS X - nope, Quicken on Mac is ugly. Well anyway, since the topic is Camino, I'll not write about how glad I am that I made the switch.</p>
<p>I am a satisfied user of Firefox on windows and linux systems. Even on Mac OS, I don't have any complains about Firefox. At the level I use it, it works as good as it works on windows XP. Arguments in favor of <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/" title="All about Camino">Camino</a> - which is a Mac variant of Gecko browsers, on its webpage are pretty compelling. So beginning with its version 0.8.0 or so, I started trying out the browser. I download every new version that comes, waiting to see if it reaches a stage when I can replace Firefox with Camino on the Mac system.</p>
<p>So far that hasn't happened - although 0.8.3 came pretty close. I think the only thing I am missing in Camino is <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/live-bookmarks.html" title="What are they?">live bookmarks</a>. Another thing that was missing was <a href="https://addons.update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&version=1.0&os=Windows&id=10" title="Try the adblock extension">adblock extension</a>, which has become something I cannot live without now. But I was pleasantly surprised by how <a href="http://www.nada.de/mac/camino/cep.html" title="Camino ExtraPrefs page">Camino ExtraPrefs</a> fills that void.</p>
<p>All in all, Camino has improved a lot in tha last few versions - and is getting better. I am looking forward to the day when it can finally replace Firefox on my Mac system. Currently, Firefox rules!</p>
