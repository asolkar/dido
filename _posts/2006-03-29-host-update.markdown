<p>My <a href="http://www.hostcolor.com" title="Hostcolor">web host</a> recently upgraded their systems to update control panel and operating system on the server my site is hosted. Well, it did not go quite as smoothly as I would have liked.</p>
<p>As you probably can see, some parts of the site are not functioning properly - specifically <a href="http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?method=4&dsid=2222&dekey=Common+Gateway+Interface&curtab=2222_1&linktext=Common%20Gateway%20Interface" title="Common Gateway Interface">CGI</a> and <a href="http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?method=4&dsid=1512&dekey=server-side+include&curtab=1512_1&linktext=server-side%20include" title="Server Side Includes">SSI</a>.</p>
<p>I am working with the host to get this ironed out as soon as possible. I'll post an update when it is done.</p>
<p>Bear with me!</p>
