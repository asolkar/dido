<p>Its been on my to-do list for a while to give <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/ajax-programming?method=22&ff=1" title="What is AJAX?">AJAX</a> a shot. Finally got some time over last couple of weekends to come up with this feed reader as a learning project:</p>
<li style="margin-left: 30px"><a href="http://st.mahesha.com/feedr/" title="AJAX experiment/learning project">News that matters...</a></li>
<p>Most AJAX tutorials I read on the web were helpful only if one is planning to write a monolithic JavaScript - as against object oriented, reusable code. Most JavaScript tutorials were also pretty superficial when it came to <a href="http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?method=4&dsid=2222&dekey=Object-oriented+programming&gwp=8&curtab=2222_1&linktext=Object-oriented%20programming" title="Object Oriented Programming">OOP</a>. I found <a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/mesh/archives/2006/01/encapsulating_a.cfm" title="Encapsulating Ajax XMLHTTPRequest Calls within JavaScript classes">this one by Mike Chambers</a> most useful. May be because his example does almost exactly what I was planning. Thanks Mike!</p>
<p>All in all, AJAX seems to be a cool and easy new technology to implement interactive content on a website. I am sure things get more and more difficult as you start implementing richer feature set. May be I'll find out if I add features to the news reader.</p>
<p>I haven't tested it a whole lot on <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym>, I don't use it much anyway. But it works OK on almost all other browsers I use - <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/" title="About Firefox">Firefox</a>, <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/" title="About Camino">Camino</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/" title="About Safari">Safari</a> - to name a few!</p>
