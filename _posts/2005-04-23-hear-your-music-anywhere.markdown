<p>It all began when I first bought the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/" title="Apple iPod">iPod</a> - the generation one (I've upgraded to <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodphoto/" title="Apple iPod Photo">iPod Photo</a> since!). <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" title="Apple iTunes">iTunes</a> quickly became the source of almost all my music. It used to be audio CDs before that. That was until I discovered that the music I bought from iTunes could not go on MP3 CDs.</p>
<p>I had replaced my car's original stereo with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000066OBV/" title="the Sony CDX-mp70">brand new one</a> with MP3 playback just so that I don't have to carry dozens of CDs for a on a day trip.</p>
<p>So I went back to buying audio CDs and ripping then into MP3 files that I could transfer to MP3 CDs and play in my car.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks back, I heard about <a href="http://www.hymn-project.org/" title="Hymn project page">Hymn</a> - <b>H</b>ear <b>Y</b>our <b>M</b>usic a<b>N</b>ywhere. This is a brilliant piece of software. I am in almost total agreement with the <a href="http://www.hymn-project.org/jhymndoc/#intro" title="What JHymn is meant to do">intent of Hymn</a>. And so I downloaded the Java variant of Hymn - JHymn. It worked fantastically for me. It converted almost 600+ iTunes songs in to open MP3 files that I can burn into an MP3 cd and play on my car stereo.</p>
<p>I am totally against music piracy. I only hope that people don't misuse this tool and aid piracy.</p>
<p>Thanks Hymn!</p>
