<p>It usually takes me a couple of days to get out of the <i>end-of-the-holiday-season blues</i>! So now, here's wishing you all a Very Happy New Year ahead.</p>
<p>I am not disclosing my new year's resolution, but hope to stick to it at least until the end of the year.</p>
<p>In other news, under the hood of course, I moved the blog to <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2005/12/wp2/trackback/" title="What's in WP2.0?">WordPress 2.0</a>. Upgrade was like a breeze. Kudos to WP folks!</p>
<p>Until later...</p>
