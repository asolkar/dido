  content: The new theme looks great...

<p>After <a href="http://www.mahesha.com/2005/10/16/wordpress-is-the-way-to-go/" title="Word Press is the way to go">switching to WordPress</a> I was trying to get custom theme going for my blog, instead of using the WordPress default theme.</p>
<p>I finally got down to getting one online yesterday. The new theme <i>MMA Watch</i> is remotely based on the default WordPress theme. Moreover I've set it up so that I can periodically change the header image to share one of the better photographs I keep taking every now-and-then.</p>
<p>If I manage to accumulate a collection of such photographs, I wish to make a random selection of the header image. Every visit, you'll see a different theme!</p>
<p>More later...</p>
