<p>You might be wondering; you did type www-dot-mahesha-dot-com - or followed a bookmarked link to it - how on earth did you reach this blog? Don't worry, you are in the right place...</p>
<p>Over the last week I changed the mahesha.com homepage to what used to be blog.mahesha.com. The old home page was increasingly looking like a blog with every update and it was getting hard to maintain it in its format. The natural choice was to move to an actual blog!</p>
<p>The link to photo albums on this site has also changed. <a href="http://photos.mahesha.com/cgi-bin/photos_browse.pl" title="New photo album URL">Photo albums</a> now use a simpler look that matches with this blog.</p>
<p>If you haven't noticed already, there's this <i>Random pick</i> section in the sidebar - on the right portion of the main page. It randomly picks a photo from all the albums online and displays it. If you click on it, it will take you to the album it belongs to. If you stick around for more than 30 seconds, it will refresh the picture with another random pick! This feature is not very well tested with Internet Explorer - if you spot any display errors, let me know.</p>
<p>Another good thing about moving to a blog is that if you have comments on anything - preferably anything on this site, now you can post them. Click on the heading of a post you want to comment on. Then go to the bottom of the page and use the comment area to post a comment. The comments are moderated - so they won't show up on the site unless I approve.</p>
<p>Hopefully this transition will help me post updates more frequently than lately!</p>
<p>Until next time...</p>
