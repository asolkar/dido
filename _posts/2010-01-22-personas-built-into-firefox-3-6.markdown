<p>So <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">Firefox 3.6</a> was released recently, it has some <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.6b1/releasenotes/">nice features</a>.</p>
<p>In the list, there's one feature addition that bothers me - default support for <a href="http://getpersonas.com/">Personas</a>. This is not exactly a new feature, it has been around as a <a href="https://mozillalabs.com/personas/">Mozilla Labs project</a>.</p>
<p>I usually stick with the default theme of any application I use. It is the one that developers have put most effort in. But just for kicks, I have tried out Personas in the past. Each time, it did not last more than a few hours before I uninstalled it.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Personas - no matter how popular, or highly rated they are - mess up the readability of Firefox window.  I am sure it is a great distraction for people who spend most of their time playing with themes. But isn't that why there are extensions/add-ons? If someone is so inclined, install the Personas add-on and you are all set to hurt your eyes!</p>
<p>Here, you be the judge:</p>
<div class="img_container">
<a href="http://tech.mahesha.com/wp-content/images/ffx_36_with_persona_theme.png"><img src="http://tech.mahesha.com/wp-content/images/ffx_36_with_persona_theme.png" alt="Firefox with one of the popular personas" width="500px"></a></p>
<div class="caption">Firefox with one of the popular Persona themes, hurts my eyes! (click to enlarge)</div>
</div>
<p>That is Firefox with one of the more popular Personas. And here is Firefox with it's default theme:</p>
<div class="img_container">
<a href="http://tech.mahesha.com/wp-content/images/ffx_36_default_theme.png"><img src="http://tech.mahesha.com/wp-content/images/ffx_36_default_theme.png" alt="Firefox with the default theme" width="500px"></a></p>
<div class="caption">Firefox with its default theme is much more readable... (click to enlarge)</div>
</div>
<p>Not sure about you, but I'd stick with the default theme.</p>
<p>But hey! no one is grabbing me by the collar and forcing me to use Personas. So it's all good.</p>
<p>Only thing I am curious about is the thinking behind picking the Personas Labs project to be integrated into Firefox. Why not <a href="https://mozillalabs.com/prism/">Prizm</a>? Or <a href="https://mozillalabs.com/weave/">Weave</a>, that would be awesome! Or <a href="https://mozillalabs.com/ubiquity/">Ubiquity</a> perhaps. All these add value to Firefox too. May be they all have the merit, but are not mature enough?</p>
<p>I hope Personas was not picked because Google Chrome has a developing themes ecosystem... (and bunch of folks claiming <em>'Oh! look how cool my Chrome looks'</em>).</p>
<p>Granted that Personas is still a work in progress (it does not theme buttons and icons, like actual themes do), and that it is a better way to implement themes. But in the end, I still maintain that Personas was great as an add-on, and it should have stayed that way.</p>
<p>With rants and opinions out of the way, what is your favorite Firefox 3.6 feature?</p>
