<p>I installed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryl_%28window_manager%29" title="Beryl Windows Manager">Beryl</a> on my laptop that I just switched to Ubuntu Linux. It's quite an eye candy! I am loving it so far.</p>
<p>Before I installed Beryl, I was worried how it will run on my computer - not a very powerful machine by today's standards. It amazes me how well it works.</p>
<p>The installation was also a piece of cake. I followed the <a href="http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/AiGLX" title="Beryl installation on Edgy Eft">instructions on Beryl Wiki</a> command-by-command. Beryl was up and running in less than half an hour.</p>
<p>Just one note. I tried both ways of configuring Beryl mentioned in the Wiki - one by setting up new session that uses <code>startberyl.sh</code> script and the other that uses the <em>Sessions</em> system preference to add Beryl as a startup item in an existing session. I found that the latter was a much better option - at least in my case. With <code>startberyl.sh</code>, I noticed very unpredictable behavior whenever I started a new session or came out of hibernation.</p>
<p>So, let me go back to playing with the stunning visual effects ...</p>
