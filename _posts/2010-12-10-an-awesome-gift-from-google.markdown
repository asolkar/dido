<p>Google recently hosted an <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/07/live-from-googles-chrome-event/?sort=oldest&refresh=0">event about Chrome OS</a>. During the event they announced a pilot program for developers/testers to try the reference hardware - the <a href="http://www.google.com/chromeos/pilot-program-cr48.html">Cr-48 prototype</a>. I applied for it, and within 48 hours, the thing was at my doorstep.</p>
<p>They really do mean speed!</p>
<p>Thanks Google for the surprise gift.</p>
<p>Now let's get to using it and sending some constructive feedback - using just Chrome OS. No Vim to type posts, no Gimp to get and edit screenshots, no FTP client to upload images. Will see how that goes.</p>
<p>Much more to come...</p>
