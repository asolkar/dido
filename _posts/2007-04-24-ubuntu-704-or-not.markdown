<p>Over the weekend, I <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading" title="Upgrading Ubuntu 6.10 to 7.04">upgraded</a> the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EdgyEft" title="Ubuntu 6.10 the Edgy Eft">Edgy</a> to <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyFawn" title="Ubuntu 7.04 the Feisty Fawn">Feisty</a> on my laptop. The upgrade went just fine, mostly.</p>
<p>The sound is gone. Just like it was after a clean install of 6.10 a few months back. I'll need to read up a bit and get the audio working.</p>
<p>There was a broken <code>emacs21</code> module - battery had died when I installed it and I did not clean it up. The upgrade process quit once due to dependency issues with this module. I removed the module and started the upgrade again. It went through. It used all the same downloaded files from the failed attempt.</p>
<p>During the upgrade process, I was constantly worried if I was really upgrading to 7.04 (see the snapshot below). The Upgrade Manager window said <em>Upgrading Ubuntu to version 6.10</em>!. But <em>About Ubuntu</em> was already updated to read 7.04!</p>

<p>Back to work...</p>
