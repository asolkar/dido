<p>Krishna and I leave on a 9 day road trip later today.</p>
<p>We'll drive to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. We'll spend 3 days there. Then we'll go to Arches National Park in Utah - spend another 2 days there. On our way back, we may spend some time in Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>If I find a hotspot, I may add to this blog about the latest on the trip. If not, next update after the trip. We plan to return on the night of Saturday, July 10<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>Later then!</p>
