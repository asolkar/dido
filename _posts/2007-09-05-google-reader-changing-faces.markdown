<p>I use <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/" title="Google Reader">Google Reader</a> a lot. On one of my computers, I use a <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/google-reader-theme" title="Google Reader Theme - Hicksdesign">theme</a> that works really good.</p>
<p>Sometime between last night and this morning, the theme suddenly broke. When I reloaded the page, the entire look of Reader had changed. I removed the theme to checkout the new design. It was pretty neat actually. There was a <em>hide</em> arrow for the left side bar. A <a href="http://groups.google.com/" title="Google Groups">Google Groups</a> -like <em>My Subscriptions</em> drop-down.</p>
<p>But now I see, the Reader look is restored! It's back to normal! Was I dreaming? Or somehow the new design got live by mistake... we'll see.</p>
<p>By the way, its a great time to have a lot of spare cash ... <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/" title="New iPod Touch">why?</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/" title="New iMac">why??</a></p>
<p>Although I'd much rather wait for a 30/60GB iPod Touch ...</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>(9/6/2007): Looks like the new Reader look is live now!</p>
