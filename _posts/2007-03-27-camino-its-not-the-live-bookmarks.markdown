  content: "Hi Philip, I am afraid, I could never find an elegant way to use Google
    bookmarks (or Delicious for that matter) in Camino. Closest I came was importing
    them, like you mentioned. \n \nI wonder if any effort is being made to make Weave
    work with Camino. That would be neat! "

<p>I like <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/" title="Camino - Mozilla power, Mac style.">Camino</a>, but it is not my default browser on the Mac - <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com" title="Get Firefox!">Firefox</a> is.</p>
<p>So far, I was under the <a href="http://tech.mahesha.com/2005/04/08/camino-getting-better/" title="Camino getting better!">impression</a> that <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/live-bookmarks.html" title="What are they?">Firefox like Live Bookmarks</a> - or more so the lack of them in Camino - was the show stopper for me. But recently, I have stopped, although not completely, using <em>Live Bookmarks</em> in Firefox.</p>
<p>I was wondering, what changed? Turns out, I was mostly using <em>Live Bookmarks</em> like a feed reader. Once I started using <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/" title="Google Reader">Google Reader</a>, I no longer felt the need to use <em>Live Bookmarks</em> the way I was using them.</p>
<p>Secondly, I had feed that contained all the websites I visit frequently. I Live Bookmark'd that feed to get access to that list from multiple machines. <a href="http://tech.mahesha.com/2007/02/04/google-bookmarks/" title="Google Bookmarks">I've started using</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/bookmarks/" title="Google Bookmarks">Google Bookmarks</a> - via the <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/" title="Google Toolbar">Google Toolbar</a> - to maintain a globally accessible repository of my bookmarks.</p>
<p>So it was not exactly <em>Live Bookmarks</em> that I was missing in Camino. What I was missing was the ability to gain access to my bookmarks that I might have updated at work, or on a different machine etc. Now I am going to find out if there is a way to use Google Bookmarks in Camino - other than over the web of course.</p>
